# Task 1: Remove the assignments of numbers to the first and second number variables. Use one or more read commands to get 3 numbers from the user.
# Task 2: Change the output to only show:
#    the sum of the 3 numbers with a label
#    the product of the 3 numbers with a label

$firstnum plus $secondnum plus $thirdnum is $sum
$firstnum product by $secondnum product by $thirdnum
